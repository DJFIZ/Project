	<p> I'm certain anyone even remotely interested in game design has at least some notion of programming or grasps the concept. Ideally when getting into game development, one would already have at least one programming language under their belt, as learning your first language would make the development of a game quite difficult. Hopefully, most would-be game devs have a coding background. In the gaming industry, C# is the typical language utilized by most engines. C# is also often considered one of the easier languages to operate with, and I would tend to agree. Using a decent IDE such as Visual Studio makes the process of coding extremely easy and streamlined. Coding for a game however, can be somewhat challenging even with a coding background. It is important to take things one step at a time; you won't be programming the next ground-breaking artifical intelligence on your first try.
	<br/><br/>
	Coding within an engine also has its own quirks. Its very similar to having access to multiple new libraries, as new functions or otherwise unused functions become rapidly relevent to scripting. Yet the basics will always remain. C# is an object-oriented programming language, so be prepared to utilize those classes and objects. I found it beneficial to start with something fun and easy, such as having a player controlled ball roll around and collect squares. Eventually as I improved I moved on to my main goal of producing my own 2D game.

	Tutorials like the one to the right made the process really fun and easy to understand. I fully recommend checking out the tutorial-makers on YouTube.
